# phone-system
This phone system is for handling calls incoming to a Twilio phone number and routing the call to different end states depending on a number of factors.  An understanding of Twilio, AWS, python, and json will be needed to successfully setup your own instance.  Use at your own risk.  Missed phone calls, AWS charges, Twilio charges, etc. are solely your responsibility.
